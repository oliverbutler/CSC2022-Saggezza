## Development

### Forking the Repository
Click on *fork* on the top right of the Repository, then it will be forked to your own GitHub

### Cloning the Repository 
This is the process of downloading your repository to your local machine

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_repo>
```
**Note** You must clone your fork of the repository, not this one, otherwise, when you come to push changes you won't have permission to edit this repository.

### Updating the main Repository
```bash
$ git add <untracked files>
$ git commit -m "commit message"
$ git push -u origin master
```
Once you have committed your changes and pushed to *your* fork of the Repository
- Click *new pull request* on the main repository 
- Write any necessary comments
- Submit the request
- Wait for another member to review the code and merge it
